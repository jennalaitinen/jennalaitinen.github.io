     <p>I’m a very humane and social person, and I love meeting new people and getting to know all kinds of people. I’m also a very positive and optimistic person, and I tend to see the good in everything. I also really like helping people, and therefore I enjoy customer service positions. Overall, I would say I’m a friendly and an open person.</p>
     <p>I enjoy physical activities in my day-to-day life, like going to the gym and also group gym lessons like pilates and yoga. I also really like walking and running especially during the summer. Reading is also an interest of mine and I’ve been trying to read books more regularly lately. I also like spending my days with friends in a café for example.</p>
